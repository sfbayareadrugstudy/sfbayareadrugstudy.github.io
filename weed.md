# Marijuana (weed)

Marijuana, cannabis, or weed, is a lowly-addictive drug. It is normally smoked.

Though the legalization of weed has made it much easier to access, it has also made it considerably safer, and eliminated the threat of synthetic marijuana.

## Forms

* Cigars (blunts) - the most common form
* Edibles - sweets or baked goods that have THC and CBD in them
* Other forms exist, but are normally not a major concern

## Steps Parents can Take

Make sure your child knows the risks of taking CBD. If you suspect your child is taking weed, make sure it is clear that this drug use will not be tolerated.

Ensure your child knows the risks of weed on the brain.

If you suspect your child's friend is involved, contact their parents.
